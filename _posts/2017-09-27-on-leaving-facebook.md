I've uninstalled Facebook and Facebook Messenger from my phone, and am
no longer going to be checking the Facebook or Messenger websites. I
still want to make it easy for people to get ahold of me, which you can
[find more about below](#contacting-me).

This has been a long time in the making for me. Almost 2 years ago I
restricted my use of Facebook to 30 minutes a day. Shortly after that I
uninstalled the Facebook app from my phone. Around a year ago I killed
my News Feed with a Chrome extension. I spend no time using the core
Facebook product anymore.

The only thing left to go was Messenger. I used Messenger almost
exclusively in college both for chatting with friends but also for
reaching out to people I happened to meet. Today, I've finally
uninstalled Messenger from my phone.

It's rare right now for people to actively leave Facebook, but a handful
of people wish they could or are trying to. Since it's so uncommon,
here's why *I've* made this choice:

## Facebook Abuses Privacy

It's well-known that Facebook's ad-based revenue model involves
meticulously tracking users' behavior throughout Facebook and all across
the Internet. Facebook nominally allows users to control their privacy
settings, but these overwhelmingly focus on interpersonal privacy. We
have far less control over Facebook selling our personal information.
This has been written about extensively, but here are some links:

- [Get your loved ones off Facebook.](http://www.salimvirani.com/facebook/)
    - This article is one of the most comprehensive articles of
      Facebook's malpractices, covering considerations of privacy,
      politics, advertising, and much more.
- [Reasons not to use Facebook](https://stallman.org/facebook.html)
    - This post by Richard Stallman is a bit exhausting, but at least
      it's in character. Stallman brings forth a laundry list of points;
      each one is easy to dismiss individually, but they're eerie when
      taken in sum.

Privacy is a sneakily important topic.[^1984] When you have it, it's
easy to forget what kind of world it would be if we gave it up.

[^1984]:
  {-} George Orwell's *1984* is actually a really fascinating book, and
  I'd highly recommend it. Orwell weaves a compelling story of personal
  struggle, political commentary, forbidden love, and distopian
  conclusions that leaves no question why it's still a classic.

## Facebook Is a Threat to the Open Internet

With regard to the Internet, I'm definitely an idealist.

> steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the
> future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome

> Cyberspace*][ind]


Barlow wrote this letter in 1996---over 20 years ago. We owe a debt of
gratitude to all those who worked to make the Internet a tool that
anyone can use. Nominally, Facebook's goal of a more interconnected
world is in line with this original vision. But counterintuitively, much
of what Facebook is working towards tears down the progress we've
already made.

To read more about this, I suggest [The Web We Have to Save][web-save].
After being pardoned from Iranian imprisonment for being an open web
advocate, the author gives his perspective on what happened to the
Internet over the 6 years he was away from it.

It's not too late to stop this. The Internet was made to be open, and we
can still make sure that it is.

## We Have The Technology

I don't want the effects of my choices to infringe my friends and
family's freedoms. I need to make myself available online in as many
ways as possible---with open, private systems as the default. But by
continuing to use Facebook, I make the default implicitly closed-off and
privacy-invasive.

There are lots of fascinating new technologies in this space which I'd
love to see become the default:

- [Signal] is a messaging app that neither compromises on privacy nor
  social sharing---and uses some fascinating new technologies to do so.
  Signal encrypts messages by default, their client and server code is
  open source, and they're actively trying to rely less on trust.
  They're even finding innovative ways to empower users to [own their
  own social graphs][social-graph].[^mindblown] This post describes how
  they're working on solving problems that people didn't thing possible
  in the realm of private social networking.

- [Solid] is a project by Tim Berners-Lee and MIT to give data ownership
  back to those who use web apps, as opposed to those who run them.
  Imagine Facebook, but where all your posts, all your images, and your
  friend list belongs to you, rather than Facebook.

- [Keybase] is pioneering new experiences around encryption, with a goal
  of making encryption the default in all software. For more about how
  this works, read [Introducing Keybase Chat][keybase-chat]. Keybase
  Chat is friendlier for crypto newcomers and power users alike, and
  they're shipping new features at an impressive pace. They've released
  Keybase Teams (a fancy, encrypted Slack-alike app), Keybase Filesystem
  (encrypted shared files right in the file system), and even encrypted
  git (for sharing code privately).

[^mindblown]:
  {-} This post actually left me mind blown at how rigorously they're
  thinking about how to solve these hard problems.

## But Jake, the hypocrisy!

When talking about this before, people have brought up some hard
questions that I'll pre-emptively address here.

### "Couldn't you say the same things about Google?"

You're right. Between Search, Chrome history, Gmail, Maps, Docs,
YouTube, and the fact that I browse the Internet signed in, Google
probably knows more about me than Facebook!

That being said, I'm not at a spot right now where I can leave Google.
Running a personal mail server turns out to be not that easy. Google
Docs is near ubiquitous for collaborating on document drafts, with no
high-quality, open replacement. I could switch from Chrome to Firefox,
from Google Search to Duck Duck Go, or take a number of other measures.

But I'd like to think through these changes rigorously first. For
example, if I naively switched from Chrome to Firefox, but didn't change
my search engine, have I changed anything? Even though right now the
focus is on switching away from Facebook, that doesn't mean that I'm
ignoring everything else. I just want my decisions to be cost-effective.

### "Do you really not support anything Facebook does?"

I actually have a huge amount of respect for many engineers from
Facebook. They're pioneering scaling web services, have helped train
thousands of people on how to design usable web interfaces, and are one
of the best companies for releasing open source software. I'm personally
a huge fan of React, Flow, and Immutable.js.

Regardless of what I do in the short term, Facebook will continue to
train engineers to scale large systems, write maintainable software, and
contribute to open source. Even if Facebook's core product went under,
Facebook's existing open source projects would live on through their
public communities.

With regard to open source specifically, what we really want is to find
better ways to build and grow open source communities. Mozilla and
Redhat are fascinating case studies for companies releasing open
source software, but not everyone can follow this model. Patreon and
Kickstarter have helped fund *individual maintainers*, and there are
similar efforts to grow support at the community level. Even switching
from corporate ownership to corporate donations would improve certain
communities.

### "Are you saying that Facebook's service provides zero value?"

Like with any service, you pay a cost[^cost] to use Facebook's service,
and receive value in return. I judged what I gave up and what I got back
and realized I was net negative in terms of value.

[^cost]:
  {-} To be clear: I'm talking about both monetary and social costs
  throughout this section.

For the most part, this deficit comes from the high cost, as opposed to
low value---Facebook still provides a lot of value. Even for Facebook
users that only use Messenger there's a lot of value; when you throw
into the mix the value people get from features like being able to share
posts and participate in groups, Facebook's value prop gets even larger.

The main value I got from Facebook was sending messages. Given that
there are other ways to send messages at a lower cost, this choice makes
sense for me.


## Contacting Me

Going forward, here's how you can reach me:

- by SMS/iMessage: (414) 460-3435
- on Signal: (414) 460-3435
- on Keybase: @jez_
- on Telegram: (414) 460-3435
- by email: jake at zimmerman dot io

This is definitely a case of "the perfect is the enemy of the good."
None of these is a silver bullet, but each is strictly better than
Facebook in terms of privacy or openness.

The web was originally built for the people. Along the way, we
sacrificed individual freedom for collective adoption. We're now posed
to take back those freedoms while without risking privacy or openness.

What are we waiting for?
