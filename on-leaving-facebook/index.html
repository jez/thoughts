    <section>
<p>I’m taking a step towards supporting privacy and openness in the realm of social networking. I’ve uninstalled Facebook and Facebook Messenger from my phone, and am no longer going to be checking the Facebook or Messenger websites. I still want to make it easy for people to get ahold of me, which you can find more about below.</p>
<p>This has been a long time in the making for me. Almost 2 years ago I restricted my use of Facebook to 30 minutes a day. Shortly after that I uninstalled the Facebook app from my phone. Around a year ago I killed my News Feed with a Chrome extension. I spend essentially no time using the core Facebook product anymore.</p>
<p>The only thing left to go was Messenger. I used Messenger extensively in college to communicate with my close friends but also to reach out to fellow classmates or people I met while there. Today, I’ve finally uninstalled Messenger from my phone.</p>
<p>I no longer check nor receive notifications from Facebook and Messenger. I think it’s rare right now for people to actively leave Facebook, but I have a feeling that we’ll start to see it happening more and more in the near future. Since it’s so uncommon, here are some of the reasons why <em>I’ve</em> made this choice:</p>

<section id="facebook-abuses-privacy" class="level2">
<h2>Facebook Abuses Privacy</h2>
<p>It’s well known that Facebook’s ad-based revenue model involves meticulously tracking users behavior throughout Facebook and all across the Internet. Facebook’s offerings to allow users control over their privacy (see the “Privacy Settings” menu) overwhelmingly focuses on privacy from one user to another. It largely neglects privacy control between a user and Facebook those that Facebook sells data to. This has been written about extensively, but here are some links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.salimvirani.com/facebook/">Get your loved ones off Facebook.</a>
<ul>
<li>This article is one of the most comprehensive articles of Facebook’s malpractices, covering considerations of privacy, politics, advertising, and much more.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">Reasons not to use Facebook</a>
<ul>
<li>This post by Richard Stallman is maybe a bit overzealous, but at least it’s in character. Stallman brings forth a laundry list of points; each one is easy to dismiss individually, but taken in sum, it’s eerie to say the least.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Privacy is a sneakily important topic.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> George Orwell’s <em>1984</em> is actually a really fascinating book, and I’d highly recommend it. Orwell weaves a compelling story of personal struggle, political commentary, forbidden love, and distopian conclusions that leaves no question why it’s still a classic.<br />
<br />
</span></span> When you have it, it’s easy to forget what kind of a world it would be if we gave it up.</p>
</section>
<section id="facebook-is-a-threat-to-the-open-internet" class="level2">
<h2>Facebook Is a Threat to the Open Internet</h2>
<p>With regard to the Internet, I’ll forever be an idealist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.</p>
<p>– John Perry Barlow, <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence"><em>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barlow’s letter was written in 1996—over 20 years ago. I was 1 year old when this was written. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all those who worked to make the Internet a place that anyone can use. Facebook’s goal of a more interconnected world is definitely in line with this original vision. But counterintuitively, so much of what Facebook is working towards actively tears down the progress we’ve already made.</p>
<p>To read more about this, I suggest <a href="https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426">The Web We Have to Save</a>. After being pardoned from Iranian imprisonment for being an open web advocate, the author comments gives his perspective on what happened to the Internet over the 6 years he was away from it.</p>
<p>I think it’s not too late to stop this. The Internet was made to be open, and we can still make sure that it is.</p>

<section id="we-have-the-technology" class="level2">
<h2>We Have The Technology</h2>
<p>I don’t want the effects of my choices to infringe my friends and family’s freedoms. I need to make myself available online in as many ways as possible—with open, private systems as the default. But by continuing to use Facebook, I make the default be closed-off and privacy-invasive.</p>
<p>There are lots of fascinating new technologies in this space which I’d love to see become the default:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is a messaging app that neither compromises on privacy nor social sharing—and uses some fascinating new technologies to do so. Messages are encrypted by default, their client and server code is open source, and they’re actively trying to rely less on trust. They’re even finding innovative ways to empower users to <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">own their own social graphs</a>.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> This post actually left me a little bit mind blown at how rigorously they’re thinking about how to solve these hard problems.<br />
<br />
</span></span> This post describes how they’re working on solving problems that people didn’t thing possible in the realm of private social networking.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> is a project by Tim Berners-Lee and MIT to give data ownership back to those who use web apps, as opposed to those who run them. Imagine Facebook, but where all your posts, images, and friend lists belonged to you, rather than Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> is pioneering new experiences around encryption, with a goal of making it exceedingly commonplace. For more about how this works, read <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat">Introducing Keybase Chat</a>. Keybase Chat is friendlier for crypto newcomers and power users alike, and they’re shipping new features at an impressive pace—see also Keybase Teams (a fancy, encrypted Slack-alike app) and Keybase Filesystem (encrypted shared files right in the file system).</p></li>

<h2>But Jake, the hypocrisy!</h2>
<p>When talking about this before, people have brought up some hard questions that I’ll pre-emptively address here.</p>
<section id="couldnt-you-say-the-same-things-about-google" class="level3">
<h3>“Couldn’t you say the same things about Google?”</h3>
<p>This is absolutely right. Between Search, Chrome history, Gmail, Maps, Docs, Youtube, and the fact that I browse the Internet signed in, Google probably knows more about me than Facebook!</p>
<p>That being said, I’m not at a spot right now where I can leave Facebook. I’ve tried running my own mail server before—turns out it’s non-trivial. I don’t have a high-quality, open, collaborative document editor. I could use Firefox and Duck Duck Go, and probably take other measures.</p>
<p>But I’d like to think this through first. For example, if I naively switched from Chrome to Firefox, but didn’t change my search engine, have I really changed much? Even though I haven’t made this change yet doesn’t mean it’s a change I won’t make. I just want my decision to be well-justified and impactful before I make it.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-really-not-support-anything-facebook-does" class="level3">
<h3>“Do you really not support anything Facebook does?”</h3>
<p>I actually have a huge amount of respect for many Facebook engineers. They’re pioneering scaling web services, have helped train thousands of people on how to design usable web interfaces, and are one of the best companies for releasing open source software. I’m personally a huge fan of React, Flow, and Immutable.js.</p>
<p>Facebook won’t die from my immediate actions. It will continue to train engineers to scale large systems and write maintainable software. Even if Facebook did end, the existing open source communities for Facebook’s open source projects would keep them alive.</p>
<p>With regard to their open source projects specifically, what we really want is to find better ways to support open source. For example, corporate donations vs corporate ownership. Patreon and Kickstarter have helped fund individual projects, and there are people working on new ways to support these communities. Not every organization can be like Mozilla, but they’re still a fascinating case study on how to make open source software work.</p>
<p>Remember: they said we couldn’t have <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">private social graphs</a>, but look at the progress that’s already been made! I believe that we <em>will</em> figure out how to grow stable, open source communities without having to rely on corporate ownership of them.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="contacting-me" class="level2">
<h2>Contacting Me</h2>
<p>Going forward, here’s how you can reach me:</p>
<ul>
<li>by SMS/iMessage: (414) 460-3435</li>
<li>on Signal: (414) 460-3435</li>
<li>on Keybase: <span class="citation" data-cites="jez_">@jez_</span></li>
<li>on Telegram: (414) 460-3435</li>
<li>by email: jake at zimmerman dot io</li>
</ul>
<p>This is definitely a case of “the perfect is the enemy of the good.” None of these is a silver bullet, but each is strictly better than Facebook in terms of privacy or openness.</p>
<p>The web was originally built for the people. Along the way, we sacrificed individual freedom for collective adoption. We’re now posed to take back our those freedoms while without risking privacy or openness.</p>
<p>What are we waiting for?</p>
