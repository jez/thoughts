    <p>Interning at Stripe was one of the best experiences of my career. Now that I’ve chosen to return there after graduation, I’d like to share some of my thoughts. Stripe is a great company, founded on solid engineering discipline, with a great future. I strongly encourage those who have the chance to work at Stripe to do it—any critical feedback found here is given with the hope that it will help make Stripe an even better place.</p>
<p>I’d also like to give the usual disclaimer: this is just my opinion<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> If I’ve learned one thing about HCI, it’s that “the user is not like me.”<br />
<br />
</span></span>. The key words here are “my” and “opinion.” These are my views, tainted by my background, shaped by my experiences.</p>
<p>There are a few posts in this series. Feel free to read them in any order.</p>
