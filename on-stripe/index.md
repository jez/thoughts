These are some of my thoughts after having interned at Stripe. Before I dive in,
I’d like to say that working at Stripe was one of the best experiences of my
career. I strongly encourage those who have the chance to work at Stripe to do
it—any critical feedback found here is given with the hope that it will help
make Stripe an even better place.

There are a few posts in this series. Feel free to read them in any order.
